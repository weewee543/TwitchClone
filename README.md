# TwitchClone

<b>Built with MaterialUi, React-Router and ReactJS.</b>

This project I wanted to get a feel of how to style my apps with Material-UI and handle routing within the app. 

I called my data from https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/ using Axios. After grabbing that data, I used Material-UI to display everything. 

The app is optimized for all platforms. For example, on mobile you can only see one card at a time. Switching to desktop, there will instead be three cards displayed horizontally.
